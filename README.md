# Uncommon Python Error: Integer Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates a less common type of error in Python that can easily be overlooked: integer division by zero using the floor division operator (`//`).  While division by zero is a typical programming pitfall, the use of `//` might slightly obscure it for those less familiar with Python's operators.

The `bug.py` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.py` provides a solution.
